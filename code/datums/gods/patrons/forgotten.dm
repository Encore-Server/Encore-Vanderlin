Yet, after being corrupted by Hell, his death was necessary to avert the end of the world. To be a Salvationist is to remember the deity that Angros used to be before his corruption, and to mourn his loss; not to wish for his return. You occupy a peculiar position, holy lamb. The Katholikos permits your worship, as your continued belief in Angros is what sustains the Worldflame. Other faithful may respect you or pity you, but they all keep a watchful eye lest your belief change to something more sinister, and draw the ire of the Inquisition. Mourn your dead God, remember who he used to be, and bring silence to any foolish enough to wish for the return of the one who brought the world to its knees."

Angros was once the Aspect of Fire, a glorious and powerful conquerer that led the Sultanate to victory far and wide.

To be an Absolutionist is to believe that Angros' death has absolved him of any sin, and to pray wholeheartedly for his return as the rightful Aspect of Fire; not the pretender and usurper Visires. The Katholikos declares you a heretic of the highest order, the common faithful despise you, the Inquisition seeks your head for the pyre. Even those Salvationist fools, your so-called brethren, want you snuffed out. Will you endure through these trials, sacrifical lamb, and burn in a blaze of glory?"
